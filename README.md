# domletters â€” count dominant letters
Mike Bottini and Bart Massey 2021

This repository contains a program that counts dominant
letters in alphabetic words of an ASCII text read from
standard input, printing the total count on standard output.

An "alphabetic word" is any sequence of one or more
ASCII letters (`a`-`z` and/or `A`-`Z`) surrounded by
whitespace. For example

    This isn't an "incomplete sentence". Really
    not.

contains just three words: `This`, `an` and `Really`.

The "dominant letter count" of a word is the maximum number of
times that a given letter appears in the word, treating
upper and lowercase letters as equivalent. Examples:

* The dominant letter count of `any` is 1, since the most any
  letter appears is once.

* The dominant letter count of `bookkeeper` is 3, since `e`
  appears three times.

* The dominant letter count of `Arable` is 2, since `a`
  appears twice (once uppercase, once lowercase).

## Build and Run

### Dependencies

This project is built on top of Leiningen, Clojure, and the Java JRE. Thus,
you'll need to install Leiningen.

To build a standalone JAR, type

    lein uberjar

To run the program through Leiningen once it is built, type

    lein run < PATH

where `PATH` is the path to some input file.

Alternatively, you can run the uberjar with the Java JRE.

    java -jar target/uberjar/domletters-0.1.0.standalone.jar < PATH


## Example

    $ lein run < resources/sentence.txt
    20
    $ lein run < resources/swift.txt
    71
